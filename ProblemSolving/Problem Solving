A Cat, a Parrot, and a Bag of Seed
==================================

Define the problem
There are 3 objects (cat, parrot, seed) that the man must move from one side of 
the river to the other. He can only move one object at a time. The insight is 
that he cannot move the seed first (cat would eat the parrot, nor can he move 
the cat first (parrot would eat the seed) - he must move the parrot first. The 
overall goal is to get all three objects from one side of the river to the other
side safely.


Break the problem apart
The constraints are that neither the cat and the parrot nor the parrot and the 
seed can be left alone on either side of the river. Let define two objects to be
compatible if and only if one won’t eat the other if left alone (and vice-versa)
. We can break this problem up into two subgoals. The first subgoal is when the 
man moves the first object, he must make sure the two remaining objects are 
compatible. The second subgoal is making sure the first and second objects that 
the man has moved are compatible (because they will be left alone, when we go 
and retrieve the final object). 

Identify potential solutions
From the insight earlier, the man must move the parrot first. Now that the 
parrot is out of the way the man needs to pick the second object such that it 
will be compatible with the parrot. Unfortunately, neither the cat nor the seed 
is compatible with the parrot. But the man can still bring over either the cat 
or the seed AND take back the parrot. Let’s have the man bring over the cat, and
take back the parrot. Now we have the cat on one side, and the man, the parrot,
and the seed on the other side. Have the man set down the parrot, and bring the 
seed over to the cat side. Now we have the man, the cat and the seed on one side
and the parrot on the other side. Since the cat and the seed are compatible, all
that’s left to do is for the man to go and get the parrot.

Evaluate each potential solution
Each solution satisfies each of our subgoals. I believe the solutions should 
work in all cases since we’ve made sure that in each step the objects are 
“compatible”.

Choose a solution and develop a plan to implement it
Solution:
  1) Have the man take the parrot to the other side.
  2) Have the man take the cat to the other side, and bring the parrot back over
  	 to the original side.
  3) Have the man take the seed over to the other side (with the cat).
  4) Have the man take the parrot over to the other side.

I ran through a test case to check if at any point the man leaves two objects 
that aren’t compatible. This solution passes the test, so I believe it works.


Socks in the Dark
=================

Define the problem
There are 20 total socks. 10 of them are black, 6 of them are brown, and the 
remaining 4 are white. The question asks for 2 things. The minimum number of 
socks we have to select in order to guarantee 2 black socks, 2 brown socks, OR 2
white socks and the minimum number of socks we have to select in order to 
guarantee 2 black socks, 2 brown socks, AND 2 white socks.

Break the problem apart
The constraints are we can't draw more socks than we have of each color, but we
must draw atleast 2 socks to form a pair. The subgoals were already defined in
the problem. Our first subgoal is to find the minimum number of socks we have to
draw in order to guarantee that we get atleast one matching pair. Our second
subgoal is to find the minimum number of socks we have to draw in order to 
guarantee that we get a matching pair of each color.
